# VyOS nightly builds

VyOS nightly builds are automatically produced from the `current` branch every day.
They include all the latest code from maintainers and community contributors.

Nightly builds _do not receive any testing_ before upload. They can be broken in the most bizzare ways,
up to and including failing to boot. They are only for testing latest code.
