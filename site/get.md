# Get VyOS

VyOS has three release "channels": nightly builds, monthly snapshots, and LTS releases.

## Nightly builds

Nightly builds are automatically produced every day and include all latest code
from maintainers and community contributors.

They aren't hand-test before upload, and occasionally may not even boot.

Nightly builds are for you if you...

* want to help us test latest VyOS code
* want to check whether a bug is fixed in the latest code
* made a patch and want to test it before making a pull request

Get nightly builds from [downloads.vyos.io](https://downloads.vyos.io/?dir=rolling/current/).

## Monthly snapshots

Monthly snapshots receive some testing to ensure they aren't badly broken.
They include all experimental features.

We recommend them for home networks, lab use, and non-critical production routers.

Get them from our [snapshots page](/snapshots).

## LTS release
